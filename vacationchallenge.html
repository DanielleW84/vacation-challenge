          <h2>Why South Africa?</h2>
          <h3>South Africa from East to West</h3>
          <p>
            A few years ago, I had the incredible opportunity to travel to South Africa with my mum on an organised trip. We started in the east, in Johannesburg, and went west to Cape Town. It was one of the most memorable experiences we've shared, and I truly value the chance to create special memories like this with her.
          </p>

          <p>
            Along the way, we explored many fascinating places—from the vibrant city of Johannesburg and the historic township of Soweto to the stunning panoramic countryside views. A major highlight for me was Kruger National Park, where seeing animals in the wild felt magical. We also visited Addo Elephant Park, which was just as breathtaking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our journey continued with wine tasting in Stellenbosch and stops in charming villages on the route to Cape Town. The food, the people, and the natural beauty of South Africa left a lasting impression. I hope to enjoy many more trips like this with my mum in the future.

              <h4>Kruger National Park</h4>
              <p>
                Kruger National Park is one of Africa’s largest and most famous game reserves, located in northeastern South Africa. Spanning nearly 20,000 square kilometres, it's home to an incredible variety of wildlife, including the iconic Big Five: lions, elephants, leopards, rhinos, and buffalo. The park offers diverse landscapes—from open savannas to dense bushveld—and supports over 500 bird species and numerous reptiles and plant life. Visitors can explore Kruger through guided safaris, self-drive routes, and luxury lodges or rustic camps. Its well-preserved ecosystem and world-class conservation efforts make it a top destination for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts alike.

              <p>
                During our stay at Kruger National Park, we spent a few unforgettable days split between Manyeleti Game Reserve and Shalati Safari Camp. It was an incredible experience—each day began with an early morning safari and ended with another in the late afternoon, allowing us to witness wildlife in their most active moments. We were lucky to see four out of the Big Five, missing only the lion, but spotting a cheetah and catching a rare, brief glimpse of a leopard, which felt like a once-in-a-lifetime moment. One of the highlights was a full-day safari across the entire park before we moved on to our next destination. The food at the camp was also exceptional, adding comfort and flavour to an already extraordinary adventure.

              <p>
                Neethlingshof Estate has a timeless charm that immediately stands out. Set in the heart of Stellenbosch, the estate is surrounded by rolling vineyards and framed by distant mountains, creating a peaceful and almost storybook-like setting. The historic Cape Dutch architecture, especially the manor house, gives the place a sense of heritage and elegance. Walking along the estate’s famous avenue lined with stone pines feels like stepping into a postcard. Beyond its beauty, the estate is also committed to environmentally responsible practices, which adds to its authenticity and appeal. It’s the kind of place where you can truly feel the history and care behind every detail.

              <p>
                What I loved most about Neethlingshof Estate was that it gave me my very first wine tasting experience—and it couldn’t have been a better place for it. We joined a guided tour that walked us through the entire winemaking process, from the vines to the barrels, and learned how each type of wine is crafted with care and tradition. The estate itself was stunning, and the tour made me appreciate just how much passion goes into every bottle. At the end, we tasted five different wines from their collection, each one offering something unique. It was a relaxed, enjoyable experience that opened my eyes to the world of wine and left me with a great memory.

              <h4>Seal Island Cruise</h4>
              <p>
                The Seal Colony Cruise from Hout Bay was one of the most exciting experiences of our trip. We set off from the harbour on a scenic boat ride toward Duiker Island, where thousands of wild Cape Fur Seals live freely in their natural environment. As we approached the island, the sight and sound of the seals was incredible—some lounging on the rocks, others diving and playing in the waves just meters from the boat. Being so close to them in the open sea was both thrilling and peaceful, and the views of the coastline along the way made the whole cruise even more unforgettable.

              <h5>What I like about it</h5>
              <p>
                What I liked most about the Seal Colony Cruise was the stunning combination of sea, seals, and mountain views—truly nature at its best. Watching the Cape Fur Seals in their element, surrounded by the rugged beauty of the coastline, was such a peaceful yet powerful moment. Unfortunately, like with whale watching, it’s hard to capture the experience on film. There are often lots of people trying to take the same shot, which can make it tricky to get that perfect picture. But honestly, it’s one of those experiences where you’re better off just soaking it all in and enjoying the present moment as much as you can.
